I have an assignment from the University Subject (Psychology of Adjustment), which is called  PSYCHO-SOCIAL EXPERIENCE OF LOST DUE TO COVID-19, which requires us to search and interview a university student who experienced lost family members due to Covid-19.

Sorry to ask this question since it is very sensitive to ask about an unfortunate event involving someone leaving us. Do you experience the loss of your family members due to the infection of Covid-19, or do you have any university friends who suffer from the lost? Hope that this question does not offend you and sorry again for me to ask this question.
